# Tic-Tac-Toe GO

This is a Tic-Tac-Toe game with an AI opponent using the Alpha-Beta pruning algorithm to optimize move selection. The AI competes against itself in a simulation of 100 games.

## How to Run the Project

1. Ensure you have [Go](https://go.dev/) installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd <your-repo-name>
   ```
3. Run the game simulation:
   ```sh
   go run main.go board.go cpuPlayer.go mark.go position.go
   ```

This will execute 100 AI vs. AI games and display the results in the terminal.

Enjoy playing with the AI! ðŸš€
